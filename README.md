# WooCommerce Point of Sale Plugin

A simple front-end for taking WooCommerce orders at the Point of Sale.

## Usage

This plugin is in alpha at the moment and should be used by no one! However, if you are a developer and have a development install of WooCommerce then please do download, install and play. I'm happy to take advice and feature requests via https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS/issues

Once the plugin is installed you should go to http://yourshop.com/pos to see the Point of Sale interface.

## DEMO

To view a live demo of the WooCommerce POS Plugin go to http://woocommerce-pos.kilbot.com.au/pos/ with login/pass: demo/demo.
