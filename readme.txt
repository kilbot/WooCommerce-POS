Finally, a Point of Sale plugin for WooCommerce! Sell online and in your physical retail store - no monthly fees, no need to sync inventory.

== Description ==

WooCommerce POS is a simple interface for taking orders at the Point of Sale using your [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) store. WooCommerce POS provides an alternative to Vend or Shopify POS - no need to sync inventory and no monthly subscription fees.

= DEMO = 
You can see a demo of the WooCommerce POS plugin in action by going to [http://demo.woopos.com.au/pos](http://demo.woopos.com.au/pos) with `login/pass` : `demo/demo`

* GitHub: https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS/

= REQUIREMENTS =
* WooCommerce >= 2.1.0

WooCommerce POS uses IndexedDB to persist the product database on your computer or device. [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) is currently a 'Candidate Recommendation' specification by the W3C and is not implemented by all browsers. To see if your browser is compatible please check [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/indexeddb).

If your browser does not support IndexedDB, WooCommerce POS will fallback to using the product database on your server via the WooCommerce REST API. The Point of Sale system will still function but searching and filtering will be slower. Some planned features for WooCommerce POS will also only be available for browsers that support IndexdedDB.

** For the best experience please use a modern browser such as [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) **
